# solar-plant-monitoring-system
Purpose of this project is to provide remote monitoring and work control of power plant. Monitoring is consist of collecting data using properly sensors and MCU, sending data over LoRa technology and finally showing that data to end users.
Work control implies that end user is able to take diferent kind of action such as cutting plant off the grid or any other security switching operation. This commands from end user to MCU are sent using MQTT protocol to accomplish immediate system reaction. 

Hardware equipment used: 
- RAK4631 | WisBlock LPWAN Module
- RAK1901 | WisBlock Temperature and Humidity Sensor
- RAK1903 | WisBlock Ambient Light Sensor
- LoRaÂ® Antenna

-RAK7271 | WisGate Developer Base
